        <p><em>Cat</em> is awesome because <strong> it is cute, adorable, and friendly</strong>. I actually have a bad history with cats.
        One day when I was reterning from the school, <strong> a cat attaced me </strong> and since that day I get scared from them.
        I like cat and I think their cool yet I cannot touch them or play with them. <br> The end.
